This release includes two new recipes:

1. "Drive a Flash App Using Cuke4AS3" walks you through setting up the environment for testing Flash apps.
1. "Manipulate Time" shows you a couple of different ways to make your tests faster by speeding up the clock.

We've also substantially updated one recipe:

1. "Test On iOS Using Frank" now covers the new version of the Frank toolkit, which is now much more automated and primarily command-line-driven. Thanks to Pete Hodgson, the creator of Frank, for taking the time to walk us through what's new.
