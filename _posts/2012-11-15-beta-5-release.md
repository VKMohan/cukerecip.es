This release includes two new recipes and a new appendix:

1. "Test Android Apps With Calabash" demonstrates using Cucumber to drive an Android application.
1. "Define Steps as Regular Ruby Methods" shows you a way to declutter your step definitions and make your tests more maintainable.
1. "RSpec Expectations" gives you a quick overview of writing good pass/fail assertions using RSpec Expectations, the assertion framework we use most heavily in the book.

We've also substantially updated "Test .NET Code Using Cucumber
Syntax" and "Drive a Windows App Using White" to use Visual Studio
Professional and the NuGet package manager.
