This new release includes two new recipes:

1. "Test Through Multiple Interfaces Using Worlds" explains how to drive both your GUI and your API from the same set of Cucumber features
1. "Drive JavaScript / CoffeeScript Using Cucumber-JS" shows you how to use the full power of Cucumber in a JavaScript environment

We've also added a little real-world advice to our recipes on HTML
tables and Sikuli.  Thanks to readers Dean Cornish and Chuck van der
Linden for weighing in on these topics in the forums.
