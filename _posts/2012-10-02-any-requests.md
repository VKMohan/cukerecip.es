Hi, everyone.

Are there any Cucumber techniques you'd like to see covered in the book? These could be tricks you've discovered, tasks you've always wondered how to perform, or follow-ons for specific recipes.

For example:
* A follow-on to the JavaScript/CoffeeScript recipe that shows the next step of firing up a headless browser such as Zombie.js
* A discussion of the Page Objects technique as it applies to web testing

We'd love to hear from you, either in the [Pragmatic forums][forums] or on the book's [Twitter account][twitter].
